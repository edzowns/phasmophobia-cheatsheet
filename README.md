# Phasmo Checklist

## Live Version Here: [https://edzowns.github.io/phasmophobia-cheatsheet/](https://edzowns.github.io/phasmophobia-cheatsheet/)

Forked from un0btainium's [Phasmophobia CheatSheet](https://github.com/un0btanium/phasmophobia-cheatsheet) project, the Phasmo Checklist is a collection of my changes that work for me and my friends. Instead of contributing to the original by adding my own design choices (wording, coding, functionality, or otherwise), I decided it was likely best to create a fork for myself.

My version stickies the ghost header on scroll,~~ adds purplse darkmode,~~ allows you to select/deselect the ghost to remove them from the evidence list, changes required primary evidence to 1 for secondary evidence to appear, removes about/contact, adds missing ghost behaviours, modifies a lot of wording to allow for less ambiguity, and adds some other bits that will open up further features down the line.

## Coming Soon

- ~~Select/deselect ghost instead of finding the specific evidence to randomly ignore~~ - Added
- Add strength/weakness/description tooltips (also in the coming soon of the master project)
- Add all data to local storage as backup
- Add dark to light button for those suffering with nyctalopia
